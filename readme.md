# A Speedy Rails Powered API

## This is a demo app used in a presentation to ArchRails on October 8, 2015

The speedy api demonstrates how to more efficiently read and use thousands of database records in a Rails / ActiveRecord application.

Clone the reposititory and run bundle install
Run rake db:setup to setup the database and insert the seed data
Fair warning: the db:init sets up 1000 scores for each game & user.  It will take a few minutes!

Benchmark tests in the benchmarks folder can be run by typing ruby [filename] at the command line
